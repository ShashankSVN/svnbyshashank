XML - EXtensible Markup Language

XML vs HTML: 
	- XML was designed to describe data.
	- HTML was designed to display data.
 
XML can be read by programming lagugue

XML Server Side/client Side:
java/java script

XML parsing:
DOM Parser[Document Object Model]/SAX Parser[Simple API for XML]
Java Packages: 
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder and org.w3c.dom
javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser and org.xml.sax

XML Binding: Convert object to / from XML file
JAXB - Java Architecture for XML Binding [Server Side]


XML Validation:

XSD - XML Schema Definition
DTD - Document Type Definition

XML Transformation: 

XSLT - Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
XSL- XSLT a subset of XSL


Advanced XML technology:
1. XPath - XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.
	 - XPath is a major element in W3C's XSLT standard - and XQuery and XPointer are both built on XPath expressions.
2. XQuery - XQuery is designed to query XML data
	  - XQuery is to XML what SQL is to database tables.


XML and Java:
XML & Properties- The java.util.Properties class has build-in functionality to convert properties file into XML file or vice versse


XML and Java script:
XMLHttpRequest 
	- The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes.
	- Update a web page without reloading the page
	- Request data from a server after the page has loaded
	- Receive data from a server after the page has loaded
	- Send data to a server in the background









Document Type Definition:
A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

A DTD can be declared inside an XML document or in an external file.

Why Use a DTD?

With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to use a standard DTD for interchanging data.

Your application can use a standard DTD to verify that the data you receive from the outside world is valid.

You can also use a DTD to verify your own data.


An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".

An XML document validated against a DTD is "Well Formed" and "Valid".
